<!--This is the SKILLS .-->
<h4 id="SKILLS"></h4><center style="font-size:4rem;font-family:'Bebas Neue', cursive;color: #f9cf0a"> SKILLS </center>

  <p> The most well known skill of Beatrix is her strength and speed. As trained by both Bill and Pai Mei, she makes for one of the world best assigns by have great amount of speed and strength. This scene above is one of Beatrix's greatest moment of strength and speed. She is able to Three-Inch Punch her way through a woodne coffin barried six feet underground and digs her way out of the ground in order to free herself from being barried alive by Budd.
        </p>

</div>

<p> Another skill that such a bad ass Assassian like Beatrix should poccess is strong combat skills. Whether it be hand-to-hand combat, knowing how to us weapons such a any gun or edged blade she is an expert to say the least. However, her weapon of choice is definitely the Katana blade which she proves she is skilled at in her deadly battle again O Ren Ishii and her army of soldiers called the crazy 88.</p>

    
<div class="combat"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvvMMTwwgoU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p> Although not as looked upon as her other arsonal of skills, the one that makes her the most bad ass is her perserverance, she is goal determined and will stop at nothing until she get whats she wants. Even if she is beaten down, tortured or even brought close to death she still manages to have the mental capacity to keep gettign up and moving forward. This is shown significantly with in the cruel tutelage of pai mei. She is exhausted from her training but still finds the strength to follow Pai Mei's orders. Even he notices that this is her greatest strength of all </p>

<!-- Budd image .-->
<img src= Budd.jpg width="50%" height="auto">

<p> The worst kill was not that bad since Budd ended with a Black Mamba's venoumous bite to the face, however, it just sucked because Elle killed him and not Beatrix who rightfully deserved that kill.
<p>  

<!-- Elle Driver image .-->
<img src=d46b688d688cbc4efdd4eeeb055c1afc.jpg width="50%" height="auto">

<p> Elle Driver's was the final Assassian right before Bill on the Death List Five. Her death was the worst sinc Beatrix didn't even kill her. After escaping the coffin to fight Budd, Beatrix realizes that Elle had already killed, she attacks Elle and they begin to fight each other ending in Beatrix plucking out Elle's other eye making her completely blind. This kill was also the worst because there beef was so deep and besides Bill audiences really wanted to see Elle get it hard from Beatrix. 
</p>  

<!-- Vernita Green image .-->
<img src=7b83abbc9eecb82b28cace7732585e62.jpg width="50%" height="auto">

<p> Vernita Green's death was another dull kill since it started with an intense knife fight which paused when Vernita's daughter Nikki came home and ended with a knife to the chest. It is just a less intense kill that ended with baggage now that her daughter Nikki might want revenge.  
</p>  


<!-- o Ren Ishi image .-->
<img src=e5409c7287857a5ac918a4a70e9023a5.jpg width="50%" height="auto">

<p> O Ren Ishi's death was the longest and most extereme, starting with Beatrix having to get through her bodyguards and assisstants Sofie Fatale cutting off her arm, killing GoGo Yubari by stabbing her in the head with a table leg nails. Defeating her army the Crazy 88 on in a battle 1 against 88 with nothing but herself and her Katana Blade. In the end killing O Ren Ishii in a battle 1 on 1 slicing her forehead off. Honorable and Gaury.  
</p>  

<!-- Sophie Fatale & GoGo Yubari image .-->

<!-- Bill image .-->
<img src=b916bc3d8dd662bb10d8ef8ab050f4d0.jpg width="50%" height="auto">

<p> the most significant and best kill was of course Bill. After getting through the enter Deadly Viper Assassianation Squad, she had come to Bill. Killing him with the 5 point exploding heart technique that Pai Mei taught her but never taught Bill. It was so intense and the perfect amount of revenge that even Bill was satisfied with his death. Best of all she ended with getting back her daughter B.B.

<div style="text-align: centre;">
	<p style= "font-size: 1rem; color: #dad3ab; font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;"> Although it seems as though Beatrix's story came to a happy ending with her and B.B. finally being together, there has been remours as well as a fan bass despire for Tarnentino to make his last and final fil to be Kill Bill Volume 3. So this may mean that this may not be the last we see of Beatrix Kiddo.

<div style= "text-align:centre;">
	<p style= "font-size: 1rem; color: #dad3ab; font-family: 'Cutive Mono', monospace;;"> Despite Beatrix's revenge on Bill and the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad being fufilled, there is still one part of the story that is left unanswered. Will Nikki come for Beatrix? After Beatrix killed Vernita Green, she told Vernita's daughter Nikki that if one day, she still feels  Beatrix will be waiting for her. And so we are left desiring for the revenge story of Nikki and along with it, the return of Beatrix Kiddo.
